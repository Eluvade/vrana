Vecteurs de l'esprit or Pemba

Within the limitations of a group, the separating borders of the subjective individual and itsâ€™ peers are spacers which represent the agglomerated unacceptance of one another. 
The looming emotional ego and the proclivity for self righteousness that follows, further embeds the acknowledgement of not only separation, but aversion. 
The fabric of unity will never be felt by hands whose embrace is halted by the idealistic notion of absolute eveneness.
